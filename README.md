# module_6_challenge
This is a weather app that is to show case the current  temp, humidity and wind speed of the user's selected city. 
Ran into many issues integrating the API data. API unable to be rendered due to CORS errors that I'm not sure how to correct. Weather icons are included in the website, are are coded to display when button is selected. 
Unable to debug errors without more time. Due to time constraint, submitting incomplete webpage.
